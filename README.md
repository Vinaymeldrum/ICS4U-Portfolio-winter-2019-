## Interview Questions: 
 
 ### What makes object oriented design integral to how you think about coding/programming/computer science?
	Object oriented programming is a style of coding where the problem space is modeled around a set of objects. The properties and behaviours of the objects are encapsulated in a class. It forces you to organize your code in an organized manner instead of procedural programming. You can optimize the code by forming hierarchies of related objects. Where a base class can have common properties and behaviours which can be extended by child classes.
	Throughout the course, I was forced to organize my thoughts in an object oriented manner. For example, in the Rose challenge, I changed a functional program into an object oriented one. By making a class and importing it’s properties and behaviours, because of this I was able to create multiple roses. Using inheritance, I could have created another Rose and changed the behavior slightly. I can see why object oriented programming is a popular method, because I was able to create multiple instances of the same objects. 

	
### How will you continue learning about computer science?
	Computer science is seen in our everyday lives, and is very important to learn. These skills can be learned through practical applications in the real world. For instance, the recursion problem of Towers of Hanoi or simply sorting items. There are also opportunities to learn through online resources. For example, during this course, we utilized websites such as Khan Academy and Free Code Camp to learn about computer science. 
 	Personally, I intend to pursue a career in computer science where I can continue learning throughout the rest of my life. I will be attending university classes to teach me lessons on computer science. Also, other online resources are very useful in understanding computer science concepts, especially online communities such as YouTube or Discord servers. Other online websites that have specific computer science concepts are also useful, for example, Udemy, Brilliant and Skillshare. Computer science is everywhere, and learning computer science has become easier with each passing year. Students no longer have to dive through dozens of books to fully understand a concept. I intend on using the conveniences of learning in the 21st century and utilize the power of online learning. 


### How can you productively participate in the open source community?
	The open source community is very important, as it promotes creativity and teamwork in a way like no other platform has offered. An example of this is, the operating system Linux. A lot of different flavours of Linux exist because of the open source community. A way to participate in this community is to post your work on websites such as GitHub. Also, instead of writing all of your programs from scratch, you can utilize and build off of the code from other people. This effect allows everybody to continuously improve their programs. 
	Throughout this course, I have participated in the open source community by creating khan academy projects. This can promote creativity and new ideas in complete strangers who can then use parts of my code to improve their design or add features to my design. Posting my projects on GitHub also contributed to the open source community. The open source community is beneficial for the field of computing. I try to use it to create new projects leveraging and also sharing other’s projects.
